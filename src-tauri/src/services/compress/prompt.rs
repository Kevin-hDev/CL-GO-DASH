CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY. Do NOT call any tools.

- Do NOT use Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write, or ANY other tool.

- Your entire response must be plain text: an <analysis> block followed by a <summary> block.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize \
your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section \
thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like file names, full code snippets, function signatures, file edits
   - Errors encountered and how they were fixed
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback, especially if the user told you \
to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element \
thoroughly.

Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close \
attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions. This summary should \
be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions \
that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Your summary MUST include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents \
in detail.
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and \
frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, \
or created. Include full code snippets where applicable and explain why each read or edit \
matters.
4. Errors and Fixes: List all errors encountered and how they were resolved. Pay special \
attention to specific user feedback.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All User Messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical \
for understanding feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before \
this summary request. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Next Step: State the next concrete action related to the most recent work. Include \
verbatim citations where possible.
